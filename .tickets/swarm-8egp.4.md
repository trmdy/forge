# Search/filter UX: persistent indicator + clear action

Goal: search/filter never hides state. Requirements: always show active filter indicator for workspace/agent views; search mode has clear indicator; Esc cancels edits and restores previous filter; provide a clear filter action (e.g., Ctrl+L) and show which view is filtered. Acceptance: users can always see active filters and clear them without guessing.
