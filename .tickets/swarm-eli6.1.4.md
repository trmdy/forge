# Standardize terminology + naming

Audit user-facing terminology across CLI/TUI/docs/config. Define canonical terms, allowed abbreviations (e.g., ws), and naming rules for IDs, profiles/accounts, and statuses. Ensure copy uses a consistent voice and avoids ambiguous labels.

## Acceptance Criteria

- docs/ux/terminology.md with canonical terms + synonyms table\n- guidance for ID/name display and abbreviations\n- referenced by CLI style guide and TUI theme docs
