# Help + shortcuts: align with actual keybindings

Goal: help and shortcut hints match real behavior and reduce noise. Requirements: update help to include palette, search, transcript, inspector, and view navigation; make help context-sensitive by view or mode; reduce always-on footer or make it concise; add mode indicator for search/palette/transcript. Acceptance: users can discover key actions quickly and hints never lie.
