# Demo data: explicit mode + visual badge

Goal: demo data is explicit and never confused with live state. Requirements: gate sample data behind a demo mode flag (config or CLI) OR show a persistent 'Demo data' badge when real data is absent; ensure transcript sample is also flagged. Acceptance: users immediately know when data is simulated and how to enable/disable demo mode.
