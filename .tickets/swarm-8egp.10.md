# Status feedback: transient toasts + severity

Problem: status messages persist and clutter the UI; feedback feels non-premium. Requirements: add a lightweight toast system (auto-clear after N seconds; severity styles for info/warn/error); allow actions (palette/search jump) to trigger toasts without permanent footer noise. Acceptance: feedback is visible but fades, keeping the layout clean.
