# Agent view: selection state + keyboard navigation

Goal: explicit agent selection model + keyboard navigation in Agent view. Requirements: store selected agent id/index; arrow/hjkl move selection within Agent view only (no view switching); selection persists across refresh + filtering; if selected agent disappears, pick nearest/first. Acceptance: user can move focus between cards and always knows which agent is selected.
