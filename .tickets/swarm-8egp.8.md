# Visual hierarchy: card layout + distinct state colors

Goal: stronger visual hierarchy + distinct state signals. Requirements: enforce consistent card width/padding; remove hard-coded colors and use theme tokens; create distinct visual tokens for approval vs rate limit vs error (ASCII labels/icons); ensure badges/alerts are scannable at a glance; align spacing across workspace and agent cards. Acceptance: status scanning is fast, unambiguous, and looks premium.
