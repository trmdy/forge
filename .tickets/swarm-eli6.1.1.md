# Map core user journeys + pain points

Scope:
Document the end-to-end journeys (first run, add node, create workspace, spawn agent, monitor state, respond to approvals, recover from error). Identify friction points and missing guidance.

Notes:
Use actual CLI surfaces and defaults; note where docs disagree with behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `docs/ux/journeys.md` created with:
  - step-by-step flow diagrams (textual is fine)
  - pain points and severity
  - UX opportunities prioritized
- list of blockers and dependencies called out explicitly
