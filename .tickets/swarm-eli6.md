# EPIC 17: Premium UX & Workflow Polish

Background:
Swarm already has solid core mechanics, but the UX is inconsistent across CLI/TUI and the first-run experience is sparse. The product spec explicitly calls for a "sexy" TUI and a CLI that feels premium and intuitive (Stripe-level polish). This epic consolidates cross-cutting UX improvements into a coherent plan.

Goals:
- Make the first run feel guided and safe.
- Make all CLI outputs consistent, scannable, and friendly.
- Establish a visual/interaction system for the TUI.
- Reduce confusion by improving errors, suggestions, and docs.

Non-goals:
- Full TUI feature parity (handled in existing TUI epics).
- Major backend feature development (focus is UX ergonomics).
