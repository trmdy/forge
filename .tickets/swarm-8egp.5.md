# Search UX: match counts + no-results copy

Goal: make search results legible. Requirements: show match count (e.g., 3/10) for workspace and agent filters; when zero matches, show friendly guidance and a clear next action to clear filter. Acceptance: users know whether filtering is working and how to recover when empty.
