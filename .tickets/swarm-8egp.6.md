# Command palette: hide or disable unimplemented actions

Goal: command palette only offers trustworthy actions. Requirements: hide or disable unimplemented actions; disabled actions are non-selectable and show a short reason ('Coming soon'); filtering should skip disabled by default unless user explicitly requests. Acceptance: palette never tricks users into dead ends.
