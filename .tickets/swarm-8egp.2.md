# Agent view: visible focus styling for selected card

Goal: visible focus styling for the selected agent card. Requirements: selected card uses distinct border/background with theme tokens; non-selected cards slightly muted; enforce consistent card width/padding so focus reads cleanly; no Unicode dependence. Acceptance: selection is obvious at a glance on narrow terminals.
