# TUI UX polish: interaction clarity + premium feel

Background: recent TUI features (cards, inspector, palette, search, transcript) landed quickly and feel uneven. This epic captures UX/interaction fixes to make the UI consistent, intuitive, and premium. Goals: (1) explicit focus model with visible selection, (2) search/filter that never hides state and supports clear cancel/clear flows, (3) palette and help that are truthful and discoverable, (4) stronger visual hierarchy and distinct state signals, (5) demo/sample data clearly labeled or gated. Deliverables in internal/tui and components; no API changes expected.
